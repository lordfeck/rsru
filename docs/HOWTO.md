_RSRU_ HOWTO
============

User's Guide covering installation, configuration, customisation and utilisation. Valid for Release 3.

# RSRU in brief

RSRU, or _Really Small Really Useful_, is a static website builder written in Perl.
It currently specialises in building "catalogue" style websites, so it is ideal for building a website dedicated to collections.

Sample templates are included for building a link catalogue or a software catalogue. These may be adapted to fit your needs.

# Installation

## System Requirements

- Windows, Linux or Mac OSX. RSRU has been tested on Windows and Linux but should also work on OSX.
- Perl v5.18 or later

## Readying Perl

If you are on Windows, first [install Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/). If you are using Linux or OSX, your operating system has good taste and already includes Perl.

If you have never used Perl before, run `cpan` from a command window and agree to all the defaults. This will allow installation of helper modules for RSRU.

## Installing Helper Modules

You may wish to include pictures in your website. You may also wish to generate RSS feeds so your eager audience can stay informed of your latest discoveries.
In these cases, RSRU needs some help to perform these duties.

**NOTE:** To install the graphics module on Linux, another library must first be installed. This is not necessary on Windows.

Open a command window and run the following:
