# Thransoft RSRU

## What is RSRU?
Simple static HTML page generator written in Perl. Intended for the sole task of generating my RSRU section, but may have broader usage potential. GPLv3 licence.

## What does RSRU mean?
*R*eally *S*, *R*eally *U*seful. It's the name of a section on my website which lists software matching the criteria of being really small and really useful.

## Future goals for RSRU
I've considered expanding it into a "microblogger" system. Think of a way to share clips of sites, quotes, images, whatever else.


Proper readme and description pending.
