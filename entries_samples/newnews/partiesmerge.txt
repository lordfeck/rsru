Since Labour doesn't actually do much work, and the conservatives fail to conserve much at all, the liberal democrats don't really believe in liberty or democracy, the Brexit party don't have a seat, the Democratic Unionist Party haven't preserved the union, the Scottish National Party doesn't actually want an independent nation and the others don't matter, they've figured that they should stop wasting resouces on needless dupliation and become one.<br><br>

Finally, politics has succeeded in bringing people together and they've led by example. Without all the pretend disagreement, surely a better future beckons for the United Kingdom.
