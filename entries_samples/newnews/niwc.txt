Due to a technicality in calculating the final scores and rankings, and amid ongoing beliefs that Fifa is a generally corrupt organisation, the Mexico 1986 World Cup finals have been tabulated afresh. The result is that the small nation are now winners of their first World Cup.<br><br>
The 1986 squad has been reuinted to collect the trophy, and due to the non-existence of a Stormont executive everyone is relieved that there will be no political representaion for the nation at this event.
